            <p><i> Interesting Facts about Camel</i></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Camels are social animals who roam the deserts in search of food and water with up to 30 other individuals.</li>
                <li>Camels have two rows of thick eyelashes to protect their eyes from the desert dust. They are also able to close their nostrils and lips to keep out the dust.</li>
                <li>Camels’ ears are small and hairy. However their sense of hearing is also extremely strong.</li>
                <li>The amount of water a camel drinks on a day-to-day basis can vary greatly, as they drink to replace only the fluid they’ve lost. A thirsty camel can drink up to 135 liters in one sitting!</li>
                <li>Contrary to popular misconception, camels do not store water in their humps. The humps are actually reservoirs for fatty tissue. Concentrating fat in their humps minimises insulation throughout the rest of the body, thus allowing camels to survive in such extreme hot regions.</li>
